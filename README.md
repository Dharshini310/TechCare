Hello folks 👋

TechCare is a Front-End Developer assessment project provided by Coalition Technologies.
I’m very grateful to this company, as it has helped me become a stronger and more capable developer. Building this project boosted my confidence and improved my technical skills.

During this assessment, I not only enhanced my existing skills but also learned new technologies such as Chart.js and React Chart.js.

Tech Stack Used:

React.js

For this assessment, the team provided a Figma design, and I recreated it faithfully using React.js.
